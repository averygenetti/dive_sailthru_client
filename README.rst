Dive Sailthru Client
====================

Industry Dive abstraction of the Sailthru API Client.

This is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the official client at <https://github.com/sailthru/sailthru-python-client>. That means it preserves all the original API functions (though some are improved with e.g. better error detection) and adds some new features, namely the ability to infer the type of campaign based on its name, tags, and list it was sent to.
